## Error Handling

If an error occurred, in addition to the status code provided in the header portion of the HTTP response, the HTTP response body contains an error object which provides more details on the specific cause of the error and how to resolve it.

    {
        "error": {
            "code": ERROR_CODE,
            "message": "Something bad happened",
            "description": "Here are more details about what happened"
        }
    }
